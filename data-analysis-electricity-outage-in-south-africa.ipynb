    "- Basically, the first energy shortage emerges in late 2007 and lasted until at least May 2008. \"The problem is related to the supply of coal to the coal-fired power plants.[11][12] Several other causes have been postulated, including skills shortages[4] and increasing demand for electricity around the country\"\n",
    "- Before the crisis, South Africa has been exporting its electricity to neighboring African states.\n",
    "- On January 2008, South Africa delares to cease exporting power. \n",
    "- If we only look at electricity production in July of each year, then the pattern is clearer. Before Jul 2007, the trend is upward with 3-4 small drops. Since Jul 2007, the trend has been downard and with another \"dip\" in 2015. (2015 is the second period of load shedding after 2007-2008)\n",

Extreme weather at either end requires more electricity to generate heaters or coolers. There is an association between the production of electricity and the temperature.\n"
